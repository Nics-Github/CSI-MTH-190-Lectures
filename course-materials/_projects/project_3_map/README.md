# Project-3

In this third project you and your partner will create twos maps from mass schools data. You will use the school location data to get started. It can be found at this [site](https://gis.data.mass.gov/maps/c929cd35022a41b6b5f7da7e0c205cec). There is also a map of the data [here](https://gis.data.mass.gov/maps/a7ccf184af704f5fbd17d69f935554d6) and [here](https://maps.massgis.digital.mass.gov/MassMapper/MassMapper.html?bl=MassGIS%20Basemap__100&l=massgis%3AGISDATA.SCHOOLS_PT__GISDATA.SCHOOLS_PT%3A%3ALabels__ON__100%2Cmassgis%3AGISDATA.SCHOOLS_PT__GISDATA.SCHOOLS_PT%3A%3ADefault__ON__100&b=-70.97820281982423%2C41.62564433527126%2C-70.91640472412111%2C41.65569559188851). These maps have the locations of the schools on them as well as some other information. 

# Components: 


## Asking and answering a question:
Your task is to come up with a question that can be answered with a chloropleth map. You must get your question approved and answer it using the data above. You may use additional data if necessary. Remember you do not want to recreate a population map. Rather you want to scale the data in some way (Think proportions: schools per population, private schools per public school in an area, etc. ). You will likely need to use some kind of data manipulation. 

You will also need to produce a short write up introducing the data, explaining what you have learned about your data and how your map answers the question posed above.


## Project Organization: 

You will make a new quarto file. You will read in all data necessary to that file as well as load any packages you might need, like the tidyverse. You'll need to cite your data and an add a .gitignore file if your data is larger than a few megabytes. 

It is important that you render and push all html files related to your maps. If you do not include the html files that go with your maps I will not be able to see them. You do not need to push your data (especially if it is large), but you must cite your data's source. 

# Organization

You'll have to organize your project. 
-  You'll need to download the data and store it in a folder. 
-  If the data is larger than 25mb you'll need to add a .gitignore file
-  You'll need to make a quarto file and include a yaml.
-  You have to read the data into the quarto file. 

# Citation:

You will need to cite your data's source. In addition to your data you will likely have to read some articles for domain knowledge, any of those that are referenced should be cited as well. 

# Rubric: 

### Question:

-    1 point - You come up with a question you think you can answer with your data. 

### Mapping data:

-    1 point - Demonstrates an ability to Map data with chloropleth maps

-    1 point - Demonstrates an ability to label maps appropriately

-    1 point - Source of map data is clear

-    1 point - Map does not have extraneous information (i.e. lat and long)

### Coding and write up:

-    1 point - Code is appropriately commented and readable

-    1 point - The document is rendered on time.

-    1 point - The data is introduced, along with the question

-    1 point - The question is clearly answered in a concluding paragraph.
