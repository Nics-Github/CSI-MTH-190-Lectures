## Let's discuss the 5 ps

Two examples involving competitions.

1.  [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/333/single?)

2.  [Boston Marathon](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/results/)

3x3 solver [Olaf Kuźmiński](https://youtu.be/xpmcqOZp5PQ?si=RxQNsfcM_yJhOuv1&t=721)

[Olaf's Page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2018KUZM02)

What are the five p s?

Scenerio: We write an article on Olaf's Rubic's cube career.

What should we do to be as ethical as possible?

When does it become unethical?

## Boston Marthon

Results for the [Boston Marathon](https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/results/)

## ICE Data

I'd like to use some data involving ICE later in the semester. 

However Deportation and Imigration is an incredibly charged topic.

# Data Exploration

## Reminder: Tidy data

Columns are variables.

Rows are observations.

Individual entries are called values.

The data we will deal with in this course is rectangular.
