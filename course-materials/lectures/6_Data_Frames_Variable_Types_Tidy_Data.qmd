## Tidy Data

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)

Columns are variables.

Rows are observations.

Individual entries are called values.

The data we will deal with in this course is rectangular.

## Variables

Variables can be categorical or numeric.

Variable names should be descriptiver and conform to the style guide.

## Observations

Each observation represents one member of the sample.

If the data is tidy the number of rows equals the number of observations.

## Values

All the values of one variable should be the same type (either numic or categorical).

## Example

Let's `view()` the Violations data from mdsr

```{r}
# You may need to install mdsr uncomment the line below, then recommend it. 
#install.packages("mdsr")
library(mdsr)
view(Violations)

```

1.  Is each row an observation?
2.  Is each column a variable?
3.  Are all values the same type?
4.  Is the data tidy?

## How R code variables

R give you a hint as to the types of variables in each column, look at the variable names.

categorical: str

numeric: int, dbl (float), POSIXct (times)
